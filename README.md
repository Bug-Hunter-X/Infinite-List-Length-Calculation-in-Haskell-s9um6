This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: attempting to compute the length of an infinite list. The `Bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code. The `BugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version that handles infinite lists appropriately.  This example highlights the importance of understanding lazy evaluation in Haskell and the potential for non-termination when dealing with infinite data structures.
