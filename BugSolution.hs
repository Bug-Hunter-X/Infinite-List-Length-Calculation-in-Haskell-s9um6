The solution involves avoiding the use of `length` on potentially infinite lists.  One approach is to process the list in a way that doesn't require knowing its length.  Another is to use finite-sized lists when length calculation is needed.  In this example, a take function is used to limit the evaluation to a finite prefix of the infinite list.

```haskell
-- BugSolution.hs

import Data.List (take)

infiniteList :: [Integer]
infiniteList = [1..] 

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let finiteList = take 10 infiniteList
  print $ length finiteList
```
